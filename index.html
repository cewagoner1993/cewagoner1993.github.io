                    <p>Welcome to my online portfolio! As of June 2019, I am a Store Manager at the flagship store of Shoe Carnival Inc., one of the top footwear retailers in the United States. Simply put I oversee the day to day operations of an $11 million shoe store. The best part of my job is being a part of and leading a team effort and trying to achieve our goals <em>together.</em> </p>
                    
                    <p>I obtained my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Information Systems from the University of Southern Indiana in December of 2016. It was during my senior year there that I discovered I had a passion for coding during an SQL class. </p>
                    
                    <p>My passion for coding accelerated after college when I learned HTML5 and CSS. This passion has accelerated so much I have decided to learn more languages and gear myself up for a change in careers from retail manager to web developer (See "Future Goals" section for more details. In my free time, I love to harness my skills by working on my own projects and looking for new and creative web design features and schemes.</p>
